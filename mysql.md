# MySQL

## High availability basics
### Master slave delay
#### Sources
* The master-slave latency is defined as the difference between T3 and T1. 
	1. Master DB executes a transaction, writes into binlog and finishes at timestamp T1.
	2. The statement is replicated to binlog, Slave DB received it from the binlog T2.
	3. Slave DB executes the transaction and finishes at timestamp T3. 

##### Inferior slave machines
* Slave machine is insuperior to master

##### Too much load for slave
* Causes: Many analytical queries run on top of slave. 
* Solutions:
	- Multiple slaves
	- Output telemetry to external statistical systems such as Hadoop through binlog 

##### Big transactions
* If a transaction needs to run for as long as 10 minutes on the master database, then it must wait for the transaction to finish before running it on slave. Slave will be behind master for 10 minutes. 
	- e.g. Use del to delete too many records within DB
	- e.g. mySQL DDL within big tables. 

##### Slow slave thread replay

###### Paralelle approaches
* DB based parallel
* Table/Row based parallel
* History
	- MySQL 5.5
	- MySQL 5.6
	- MySQL 5.7
	- MySQL 5.7.22

### Failover strategy
#### Reliability first
* After step 2 and before step4 below, both master and slave will be in readonly state.

#### Availability first
* It may result in data inconsistency. Using row format binlog will makes identify data inconsistency problems much easier than mixed or statement based binlog.

## Typical architectures
* [Standards to select mysql ha solutions](https://www.mysqlha.com/)

```
1. Local Failure handling (Local HA) – Can you recover quickly and automatically from DBMS and host failures?
2. Global Failure handling (Disaster Recovery) – Can you recover quickly and in an automated fashion on full site failures?
3. Zero-down Time Maintenance – Can you upgrade hardware, software, and data without taking applications offline?
4. Load Balancing – Can you effectively split reads to slaves and writes to master, and can you automatically load balance the reads to multiple slaves?
5. Performance – Does the HA/DR solution also improve the overall database performance?
6. Transparency – Can you deploy the HA solution without making changes to applications or migrating data?
7. Multi-Site Operations – Can you handle data spread over multiple data centers using both multi-master as well as primary/backup models?
8. Cloud Readiness – Can you run easily in cloud environments like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or OpenStack?
9. Hardware Utilization – Does the HA/DR solution increase application throughput and hardware utilization through active replicas?
10. Readiness for Business-Critical Use– Does the HA/DR solution have management and monitoring tools, QA, and 24/7 support with very fast response times for business-critical use? What about the HA/DR solutions maturity and number of production deployments?
```

### Dual master
#### Asynchronous replication
#### Semi-Synchronous replication
#### Group replication


### MMM (Multi-master replication manager)
* [MMM](https://mysql-mmm.org/downloads.html) is a set of scripts written in perl providing the following capabilities:
	- Load balancing among read slaves
	- Master failover
	- Monitor mySQL states
* Pros:
	- Easy config
* Cons:
	- Not suitable for scenarios having high requirements on data consistency
* Deployment: Although dual master, only allows writing to a single master at a time.
	- mmm_mond: Coordinator scripts. Run on top of a monitoring machine
		+ Create a set of virtual IPs. One write IP binds to the master and multiple read IPs bind to slave. 
		+ When a mySQL is down, it will migrate the VIP to another mySQL machine. 
	- mmm_agentd: Run on the same machine as the mysql server
	- mmm_control: Provides administrative commands for mmm_mond

### MHA (Master high availability)
* [MHA](https://github.com/yoshinorim/mha4mysql-manager/wiki/Architecture)
	- Fast failover: Complete the failover within 0-30 seconds
	- Max effort consistency: When a master goes down, it will try to save binlog in the failed master. It uses this way to keep the maximum data consistency. However, this isn't reliable way. For example, some hardware failures may result in failure of saving binlogs. 
	- Compared with MMM, 
		+ Supports devops work like health check, suspend nodes
		+ Supports semi-synchronous, GTID 
* Deployment: 
	- MHA manager could be deployed in a separate machine for managing several master-slave clusters. It could also be deployed on a single slave. 
	- MHA node runs on each mysql server. 
* Cons:
	- Needs at minimum 3 machines
	- Brain split
	- Not suitable for scenarios having high requirements on data consistency

### Other solutions
#### MySQL cluster
#### Galera
#### PAXOS
#### Shared storage such as Amazon Aurora

## Sharding
### Choose the number of shards
* If has a cap on storage:
	- Each shard could contain at most 1TB data.
	- number of shards = total storage / 1TB
* If has a cap on number of records:
	- Suppose the size of row is 100 bytes
		- User table: uid (long 8 bytes), name (fixed char 16 bytes), city (int 4 bytes), timestamp (long 8 bytes), sex (int 4 bytes), age (int 4 bytes) = total 40 bytes
	- Total size of the rows: 100 bytes * Number_of_records
	- number of shards = total size of rows / 1TB

### Shard routing strategy
#### Lookup strategy
* Pros:
	- Easy to migrate data
* Cons: 
	- Need an additional hop when query
	- If the lookup table is really big, it could also need to be sharded

![lookup](./images/mysql_sharding_lookupstrategy.png)

#### Range strategy
* Pros:
	- Easy to add a new shard. No need to move the original data. For example, each month could have a new shard.
* Cons:
	- Uneven distribution. For example, July is the hot season but December is the cold season. 

![range](./images/mysql_sharding_rangestrategy.png)

##### By customer or tenant
* If it is a SaaS business, it is often true that data from one customer doesn't interact with data from any of your other customers. These apps are usually called multi-tenant apps. 
	- Multi-tenant apps usually require strong consistency where transaction is in place and data loss is not possible. 
	- Multi-tenant data usually evolves over time to provide more and more functionality. Unlike consumer apps which benefit from network effects to grow, B2B applications grows by adding new features for customers. 

##### By geography
* Apps such as postmate, lyft or instacart.
* You’re not going to live in Alabama and order grocery delivery from California. And if you were to order a Lyft pick-up from California to Alabama you’ll be waiting a good little while for your pickup.

##### By time
* Time sharding is incredibly common when looking at some form of event data. Event data may include clicks/impressions of ads, it could be network event data, or data from a systems monitoring perspective.
* This approach should be used when
	- You generate your reporting/alerts by doing analysis on the data with time as one axis.
	- You’re regularly rolling off data so that you have a limited retention of it.

#### Hash strategy

![range](./images/mysql_sharding_hashstrategy.png)

##### By entity id
* Shard based on hashing value of a field. 
* Pros:
	- Evenly distributed data
* Cons:
	- Hard to add a new shard. Lots of data migration need to happen. 

#### Shard a graph ???
* Graph model is most common in B2C apps like Facebook and Instagram. 
* With this model, data is often replicated in a few different forms. Then it is the responsibility of the application to map to the form that is most useful to acquire the data. The result is you have multiple copies for your data sharded in different ways, eventual consistency of data typically, and then have some application logic you have to map to your sharding strategy. For apps like Facebook and Reddit there is little choice but to take this approach, but it does come at some price.

### Sharding preferences
* We could classify the layout within database into the following categories:
	- Single database single table
	- Single database multiple table
	- Multiple database multiple table
* The preference order is as follows:
	1. Single database single table
	2. Single database multiple table
		* Table vertical sharding: If within a single table, some fields have a different usage pattern and consume large amount of space
			- Take user profile as an example (name, age, sex, nickname, description). Nickname and description are usually only used in display instead of query and description is really long. They could be put into a different table.  
		* Table horizontal sharding: If data volume is big, could consider table horizontal sharding single database multiple table. 
			- Could use 50M rows as the standard size for a single table. 
			- The MyISAM storage engine supports 2^32 rows per table.The InnoDB storage engine doesn't seem to have a limit on the number of rows, but it has a limit on table size of 64 terabytes. How many rows fits into this depends on the size of each row.
	4. If concurrent volume is high, then could consider using multiple database multiple table. 
		- For example, test MySQL 5.7 on a 4 Core 8 GB cloud server
			- Write performance: 500 TPS 
			- Also note down here the read performance for reference: 10000 QPS

### Table sharding
* Use case: Single table too big: There are too many lines in a single table. Each query scans too many rows and the efficiency is really low.

#### Vertical sharding
* Operations:
	+ Put different **fields of a table** into different tables
	+ Segmented tables usually share the primary key for correlating data

![Table Vertical sharding](./images/shard_verticalTable.png)

#### Horizontal sharding
* Operations:
	+ Based on certain fields, put **rows of a table** into different tables. 

![Table horizontal sharding](./images/shard_horizontalTable.png)

### Database sharding
* Use case:
	* Disk IO: There are too many hot data to fit into database memory. Each time a query is executed, there are a lot of IO operations being generated which reduce performance. 
	* Network IO: Too many concurrent requests. 

![database Vertical sharding](./images/shard_verticalDatabase.png)

#### Limitations
##### Write across shards
* Original transaction needs to be conducted within a distributed transaction.
	- e.g. ecommerce example (order table and inventory table)
* There are wwo ways in general to implement distributed transactions:
	- 2PC 
	- TCC
* For example, some software has built-in implementations such as:
	- MySQL XA
	- Spring JTA

##### Query Cross shard
* Query types:
	- Join queries: 
	- count queries:
	- order by queries:

* Solutions:
	* Aggregate query result for different shard within application code.
	* Usually use two sets of data to solve the problem
		- One data is based on unique sharding key.
		- The other one is data replicated asynchronously to Elasticsearch or Solr.

##### Unique global key
* Please see [this](https://github.com/DreamOfTheRedChamber/system-design/blob/master/uniqueIDGenerator.md) for details

##### Reshard
* Use 2's multiply number as table's number or database's number.

# Future readings
* MySQL DDL as big transaction
* Sharding Proxy - 百度DB Proxy ???
